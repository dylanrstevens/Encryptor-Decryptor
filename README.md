# Encryptor-Decryptor
A crude and simple program with a GUI that encrypts a message to a file and de-crypts it
How it works:
1. To start off, run the Run.java file which activates the GUI script and starts the program.
2. You will have to create an empty text file for your encrypted message and put it where ever you like.
3. Follow the instructions on in the program to encrypt your message and decrypt it as well
NOTE* your decrypted message will appear in the terminal.
